6. [License](#license)

## Overview

Briefly describe what your chatbot does and any unique features. This section is meant to provide a high-level understanding of your project.

## Dependencies

List the dependencies that your project requires. You can create a `requirements.txt` file for this purpose, and then include the installation steps in the following section.

Example `requirements.txt`:

```
library1==1.0.0
library2==2.1.0
```

## Installation

Explain how to install the necessary dependencies and set up the project.
